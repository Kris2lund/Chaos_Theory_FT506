## Overview
This project investigates nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting chaotic behavior,
with a focus on numerical simulation, stability analysis, and bifurcation phenomena.

Such systems are highly relevant in engineering contexts including autonomous systems,
control, robotics, and cyber-physical systems, where small perturbations can lead to
large changes in system behavior.
